# Pyschic-Game
This game is a guessing game in which you have 8 guesses to guess the correct letter that the computer has selected.
If you fail to select the correct letter the game will then reset and a loss will be added to the "losses counter".
You win the game by pressing the correct letter and at which point the game will refresh and add one win! let's see how many wins you can get!! 
I'm having trouble atm with the refresh after you win or loose. but overall i think it is doing what I intended. Will be in early to get help on it.
I also hope I did this readme.md thing right as well! hope you have fun with the game and a great day!
